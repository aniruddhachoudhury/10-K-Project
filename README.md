Overview of DataFied Datasets and Resources

The table below highlights the datasets and verbs associated with them.

Financials – The Financials Dataset includes primary financials, descriptive company details and ratios. The companies included are all SEC reporting companies with publicly traded securities. To complement the SEC filers, EDGAR Online provides exclusive access to the OTC traded securities. Data is available as of 1999 for SEC reporting companies and 2009 for OTC filers. The Developer HackPack (evaluation plan) includes access to the consolidated primary financial statements; balance sheet, income statement and cash flow for the 5 most recent years. In addition, we provide the complementary basic company identification and metadata.

Insider Trade Data – The Insider Trade Dataset includes access to all individuals and publicly traded securities with reported insider trade data and allows for queries for specific summaries of insiders and trades. The resources for this dataset allow for queries to specific insider transactions (including buy and sell activity) and insider rosters.

Institutional Ownership Data – The Institutional Ownership Dataset is based on the 13F filings from fund managers, reporting their quarterly positions with the SEC. Based on the institutional holdings, the resources provide access to all securities and their fund owners. Queries can be made to access who owns what – either based on the specific security or the institutional owner.
